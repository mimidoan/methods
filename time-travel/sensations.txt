underarmor a bit tight, skin aches from crossed ankles, melanie's looking to my right, tippety tap tippety, thirsty need more water not tea too much jitters, humor ha it's funny, need to stretch my legs, hamstrings were made for savannahs, chairs are lame, overhead light is a fake sun, beep
nose scratch, whirr of some sorta air thing, relax shoulders eh, not as cold today as before, fatigue too many details, what is this batman music, nah more classical, smiles
